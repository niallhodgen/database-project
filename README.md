## QUB MSc Software Development
### Databases (MySQL)
### Mark: 75% (Distinction)

### Assignment Summary:

Students will undertake the design and implementation of a database system for a commercial 
accommodation booking system (Hotels.com). Their database system will mirror the operation of 
selected aspects of the real accommodation booking system. Students will be expected to 
individually create the database tables, populate them with some sample data and write SQL queries 
to demonstrate their database.

### Overview

As per the assignment brief, I created a fully normalised database for a hotel booking system. This involved multiple ERD iterations and careful consideration of key features of the system. The task was completed using MySQL through PHPMyAdmin (XAMPP).
